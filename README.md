The new AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 ) exam has recently been launched to replace the old SAA-C01 version. It is consistently among the top paying IT certifications, considering that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading cloud services platform in the world with almost 50% market share! Earn over $150,000 per year with an AWS Solutions Architect certification!

But before you become an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional, it is recommended for you to pass the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification exam first, and this is where AWS practice tests come in. It is possible that you have read all of the available AWS documentations online yet still fail the exam! These AWS practice tests simulate the actual certification exam and ensure that you indeed understand the subject matter.

This AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exam course is for anyone who is looking for a study material that provides the following:

* 390 TOP-NOTCH Questions - has 6 sets of AWS Practice Tests with 65 UNIQUE questions and a 130-minute time limit for each set.

* SIMULATES ACTUAL EXAM ENVIRONMENT - mimics the actual, and the latest AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification exam to help you pass and even ace the AWS exam!

* DETAILED EXPLANATIONS AND REFERENCE LINKS - our answer keys at the end of each set have full and detailed explanations plus complete reference links so you can check and verify yourself that the answers are correct.

* UPDATED 4 to 8 TIMES A MONTH - we have a dedicated team updating our question bank on a regular basis, based on the feedback of thousands of our students on what appeared on the actual exam.

* VERY ACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD - with inputs from the instructors and exam feedback from hundreds of our students, our Q&A board gives you the opportunity to know which topics recently appeared on the exam and better understand the AWS services and concepts covered in the test.

* VERY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTORS - our friendly team of AWS experts are able to address all your issues and COMPREHENSIVELY answer all your questions within 48 hours.

* CONTAINS A TEST REPORT - to track your progress and show you which AWS knowledge areas you need improvement.

These AWS Solutions Architect practice exams are designed to focus on the important exam topics (such as EC2, EBS, S3 and many others) hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other AWS knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic are carefully selected based on the 4 domains of the actual AWS certification exam.

Some people are using brain dumps for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you to attain an in-depth AWS knowledge, these can also result with you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.

Please also note that these AWS Certified Solutions Architect practice tests are not brain dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds to thousands of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate practice tests are meant to do.

There are a lot of existing AWS Practice Tests in the market however, most of them contain both technical and grammatical errors that may cause you to fail the actual exam. There are also official certification practice exams provided by AWS but these only have 20 or 40 questions and cost 20 or 30 USD -- a price that is comparable with having these 390 Unique and Timed Amazon Web Services practice questions!

When I was reviewing for my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam, I had a hard time finding comprehensive practice tests to help me pass my exam. I bought some of them in the market but I was disappointed because there are a lot of technical and grammatical errors in the questions. This is why I created these practice tests to help my fellow IT professionals in the industry.

We gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your exam. All the best!



## IMPORTANT NOTE

These AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate practice exams have a passing score of 72% but I highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 90% or higher on each exam.

Remember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the AWS exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these Amazon Web Services practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment on which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!
